# Flight-management
Flight management software for multi faceted users.

This is a simple flight management software that is designed for two kinds of users, 
the customer and the admin. The admin is given options to add new flights, delete
older flights, and change flight details in the records. The customer is given
options to show available flights for his destination, book tickets, and show 
details of his booking. 

There is an associated code for each admin that they have to enter for access to admin
functions. There is a log maintained to check admin activity.
